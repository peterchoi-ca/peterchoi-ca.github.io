Hello!üëã

My name is Peter Choi and I am a Cloud DevOps Engineer located in Toronto, ON, Canada. üçÅ

My professional career started at BlackBerry, where I was hired after finishing my college studies. During my time there, I managed physical servers, storage arrays, and networking, prior to the public cloud gaining mainstream traction. It's where I developed Linux system administration skills and gained an appreciation for how things work under the hood. Some of these activities included racking and stacking blade chassis, deploying software packages using Cobbler, and coordinating with network teams to allocate and configure switch ports. I was part of a team that led the deployment of co-located data centers in Waterloo, a project that was one of the largest in the region at the time.

I have over 10 years of IT consulting experience, with the last 5 years focused on helping customers in telco and public sector industries deliver business value through code and clouds. I have hands-on project experience helping teams adopt Azure, GCP, Terraform, Vault, Ansible, Containers, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines using current software development practices.

In June 2025 I've pivoted into the customer side by joining Intact, where I will be part of a team responsible for GenAI platform enablement across all the major cloud providers. It's an exciting time to be in tech, and I'm keen to work alongside the brightest people on emerging technologies.

I started this Hugo blog to share my knowledge and practice my writing skills. Thanks for stopping by!
